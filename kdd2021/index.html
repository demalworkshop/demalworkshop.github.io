Training, retraining and deploying web-scale machine learning models requires large amounts of high-quality data. Often, this is achieved via a time-consuming, labor intensive human annotation process. While in web-scale applications, there is an abundance of unlabeled, often extremely noisy data, there is a severe lack of high quality labeled data from which practitioners can train ML models that perform well on customer-facing applications. To this end, it is imperative that ML scientists and engineers devise innovative ways to deal with the constrained setting of small amounts of labeled data, and make the best use of limited (time and monetary) budget available to obtain annotated data. Thus, one needs to train dataefficient machine learning models. This has led to the proliferation of creative techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning, self-supervised learning, active learning, multi-task learning to name a few. While many of these techniques have shown to work well under specific settings, web data offers additional challenges. Web data is multi-modal in nature, it has implicit signals from user-interactions, and often involves multiple agents.<br /><br />

Given the uniqueness, importance, and growing interest in these problems, the workshop on Data-efficient Machine Learning (DeMaL) is a venue to present ideas and solutions to these problems. The full day workshop aims to bring together practitioners in both academia and industry working on the collection, annotation and usage of labeled data for large scale web applications.

                    <p><b>Abstract: </b>Transfer learning has been proposed to re-use the trained model parameters in similar machine learning applications. However, transfer learning cannot be effectively applied from one domain to a different domain. Recently, meta-learning, which utilizes prior knowledge learned from related tasks and generalizes to new tasks of limited supervised experience, has shown to be an effective approach for few-shot learning probems. In this talk, I will discuss the advantage of meta-learning over traditional classification in prediction problems and use The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cancer patient data to demonstrate that meta-learning can outperform the conventional transfer learning in cancer prediction problems. I will also present a knowledge-guided meta-learning strategy which integrates biological knowledge with meta-learning for improved classification performance on few-shot learning problems.

                    <p>
                        <b>Abstract: </b>Fundamental improvements in recommendation and ranking have been much harder to come by, when compared with recent progress on other long-standing AI problems such as computer vision, speech recognition, language models, and machine translation. Some reasons include: (1) large amounts of data making training difficult, yet having (2) noisy and sparse labels; (3) changing dynamics of context such as user preferences and items; and (4) low-latency requirement for a recommendation response. Finally, (5) the data are skewed long-tailed distributions (i.e. power law).  That is, while there is a good amount of logged data, but for many users and items in the long tail, we actually suffer from extreme sparsity of labels.) These problems means we have to make very efficient use of data to provide the personalized recommendation experiences that users expect.
                        
                        In this talk, we will touch upon many recent advances in data-efficient neural modeling techniques for recommendations and their impact in real-world products.  We will particularly focus on (a) using multi-task models with gated mixture of experts to jointly learn tasks with different label sparsity; and (b) employing recent Self-Supervised Learning techniques to robustly learn feature representations; and finish up with (c) some thoughts on the relationships between data efficiency and compressive sensing.

                    <p>
                        <b>   Abstract: </b>
Knowledge graphs have been used to support a wide range of applications and enhance search results for multiple major search engines, such as Google and Bing. At Amazon we are building a Product Graph, an authoritative knowledge graph for all products in the world. The thousands of product verticals we need to model, the vast number of data sources we need to extract knowledge from, the huge volume of new products we need to handle every day, and the various applications in Search, Discovery, Personalization, Voice, that we wish to support, all present big challenges in constructing such a graph. 
                        In this talk we describe our efforts for self-driving knowledge collection for products of thousands of types. The system includes a suite of novel techniques for taxonomy construction, product property identification, knowledge extraction, anomaly detection, and synonym discovery. Our system is a) automatic, requiring little human intervention, b) multi-scalable, scalable in multiple dimensions including many domains, products, and attributes, and c) integrative, exploiting rich customer behavior logs. We describe what we learned in building this product graph and applying it to support customer-facing applications.
